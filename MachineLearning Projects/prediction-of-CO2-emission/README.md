## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict CO2 emissions based on certain features such as vehicle characteristics, fuel type, and engine size. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and uses regression techniques to make predictions.

## Installation
To use the CO2 Emission Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Prepare your input data in a compatible format. Refer to the [Dataset](#dataset) section for more information on the input format.
2. Run the prediction script using the following command:
   
   python predict.py --input <path_to_input_data>
   
   Replace `<path_to_input_data>` with the actual path to your input data file.
3. The model will process the input data and generate CO2 emission predictions. The results will be displayed on the console.

## Dataset
The CO2 Emission Prediction Model is trained on a dataset containing historical data of vehicles and their corresponding CO2 emissions. The dataset includes the following features:

- Vehicle make
- Vehicle model
- Vehicle type (e.g., car, truck, SUV)
- Fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel)
- Engine size (in liters)

Each data point in the dataset consists of these features along with the CO2 emission value. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Training
The CO2 Emission Prediction Model is built using a machine learning algorithm such as linear regression or random forest regression. The training process involves the following steps:

1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the model using the training data.
4. Evaluate the model performance on the testing data.

The trained model is then saved for later use in the prediction phase.

## Evaluation
The performance of the CO2 Emission Prediction Model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the CO2 emissions.

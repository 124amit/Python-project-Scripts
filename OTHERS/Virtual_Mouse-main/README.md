# Virual-Mouse

A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a
system without using an actual mouse. To the extreme it can also be called
as hardware because it uses an ordinary web camera. A virtual mouse can
usually be operated with multiple input devices, which may include an
actual mouse or a computer keyboard. Virtual mouse which uses web
camera works with the help of different image processing techniques.

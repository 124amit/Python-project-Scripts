Hi, I am Annarhysa and I have crated a Notepad where people can write notes and save it as well. \
To use this notepad all you need to do is just navigate to Python-project-Scripts --> PYTHON APPS --> Notepad --> notepad.exe \
Download this notepad.exe and run it on you Windows OS. I hope you like using it.
